									<h3>Who am I?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									My name is Oscar Umana Garcia. I was born in Nyack NY, on June 30th, 2007. I live in Rockland County, with my parents and my younger sister.
                                    Both of my parents were born in El Salvador, making me El Salvadorian. El Salvador is located in Central America,
                                    with a big population of 6 million people, it is still a pretty poor country. Half of my family still lives in El Salvador, while the 
                                    other half lives in the US. Me and my family tend to visit them every other summer. It is a fun experience seeing my family after many years,
                                    but it is a sad experience when leaving.

									<h3>Why did I chose Computer Science?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I first discovered about coding from my friend in 8th grade. We were choosing our electives, and I wanted to be in the same classes as him. 
									He choose computer science, so I did as well. I knew nothing about this class, until he told me what it was about. When I first heard about it, 
									it sounded difficult and cool. I was having second thoughts joining, but I went through with it. I took Computer Science 1 and 2 my freshman 
									year, it was hard but overall I liked it. I took AP Computer Science my sophomore year,even though I had a rough start, I really enjoyed the 
									class, and realized that I still want to do coding for the rest of my high school year.

									<h3>What do I do during my free time?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									During my free time, I like to do what any other teenager would do. After school and athletics, I would normally watch Netflix or soccer games.
                                    I mostly like to watch TV shows, but when I can't find anything, I watch movies. Some of my favorite TV shows are The Flash, Suits, Avatar: The Last
                                    Airbender. The only movies I seem to watch are either Marvel or horror movies. When I'm not watching TV, that means I am playing video games or at
                                    the gym. I like to keep myself fit, which is why I go to the gym in the afternoon. If not, I am playing video games with friends. I am mostly on FIFA
                                    , but when playing with friends, I would play Warzone.
